The Lone Marauder is a 3D Action RPG playable on the Android operating System developed using Unreal Engine 4. A pirate has been falsely accused by his former crew of stealing the captain's specialized rum. After being thrown overboard for these calumnies, he finds himself washed up on a remote island. Filled with rage and vengeance, he begins his adventure stripped with no belongings, no idea where he is and no one to help. He must fend for himself by taking over islands, gathering loot and getting revenge by taking out his former crew members.
The player can control the pirate using the touch screen UI in the game. The aim of the game is to complete the main quest line, kill enemies to gather loot, find treasure and defeat the former crew members in the various levels of the game.
